# CodeSage Pipeline Documentation

This document explains the workflow and architecture of the CodeSage code documentation tool.

## Overview

CodeSage is an AI-powered code documentation tool that processes source code repositories through a series of steps:

1. **Summarization**: Extract high-level understanding from code files
2. **Chunking**: Split code into manageable pieces
3. **Embedding**: Convert chunks to vector representations
4. **Retrieval**: Query the vector database to find relevant code

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Summarizer

The summarizer analyzes code files and produces human-readable summaries. It:

- Interfaces with RepoMix/GitIngest to pull repository data
- Extracts functions, classes, and other structural elements
- Identifies dependencies and relationships between components
- Generates high-level descriptions of code functionality

### 2. Chunker

The chunker splits code files into smaller, processable pieces:

- Supports multiple chunking strategies:
  - Fixed-size with overlap
  - Semantic boundaries (function/class level)
  - Language-aware splitting
- Preserves context between chunks
- Handles special cases for different languages

### 3. Embedder

The embedder converts text chunks into vector representations:

- Supports multiple embedding models
- Stores metadata alongside vectors
- Optimizes for code-specific embedding
- Persists embeddings to disk in various formats

### 4. Retriever

The retriever enables semantic search through the code:

- Performs similarity search on embeddings
- Supports various querying strategies
- Returns context-rich results
- Handles ranking and deduplication

## Data Flow

The typical data flow in CodeSage is:

```
Source Code → Summarizer → Summary Files
          ↓
Source Code → Chunker → Chunk Files
                      ↓
              Chunks → Embedder → Vector Database
                                ↓
                      Query → Retriever → Relevant Code Snippets
```

## Usage Scenarios

1. **Documentation Generation**: Create comprehensive documentation for codebases
2. **Code Search**: Find relevant code examples within a repository
3. **Onboarding**: Help new developers understand existing codebases
4. **Refactoring Support**: Identify related code that may need modification

## Implementation Notes

- The pipeline is designed to be modular, allowing components to be replaced or upgraded
- Each step has configurable parameters to adapt to different codebases
- The system supports incremental processing for large repositories
- Output formats are standardized to enable easy integration with other tools
